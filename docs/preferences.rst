Display Face Orientation
--------------------------------------

When running the Flowify operation, this will automatically switch the viewport to *Face Orientation* mode so that you can check that the blue positive face orientation of the **Source Grid** matches the face orientation of the **Target Surface**.  Both matching sides should be blue.

.. figure:: images/face_orientation_good_bad.jpg
   
   Good and bad face orientations. Both matching sides of the source and the target surface objects should be blue for the add-on to work correctly.  Red faces denote inverted faces.

Subdivide Source Grid
---------------------------------------

This will automatically subdivide the Source Grid to the same number of subdivisions at the Target Surface.


Delete old Flowify Object
---------------------------------------

When enabled the add-on will always delete the old Flowify object of the same name whilst running.  If disabled the original object is retained.

Move Original Objects to Collection
---------------------------------------

Move the original set up objects into their own Flowify collection when the add-on is run so you can quickly show/hide the original objects.

When a corner has been confirmed the color will change to this.
