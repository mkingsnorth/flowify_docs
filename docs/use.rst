Set up Objects
------------------------

.. image:: images/source_target_objects.jpg

Once :ref:`installed<installation>`, for Flowify to work in Blender you will need to create the following objects arranged as above:

#. .. _source_object:

    The **Source Object** that you wish to deform.

    .. note::
        The deformation will only be as good as an objectâ€™s mesh topology (Faces and Edges).  You may need to add extra faces, edges or edge loops for the object to bend well.

#. .. _source_grid: 

    A flat rectangular **Source Grid** to use as a reference for the :ref:`Target Surface<target_surface>`.  This should be in a relative position to where you want the Source Object mapped to the Target Surface.

    .. note::
        .. image:: images/source_grid.jpg
        
        Flowify understands a source grid to consist of 4 sided faces with 4 distinct corners and to be entirely flat.  Its face direction (or |normals|) should also match the Target Surface.

        The Source Grid can be a simple single-faced rectangle and does not need to have the same number of faces as the :ref:`Target Surface<target_surface>`.

#.  .. _target_surface:

    A **Target Surface** that can either be:
    
    * An grid shape of  **evenly spaced** 4 sided faces with 4 distinct corners, **or** 
    * A cylindrical shape of **evenly spaced** 4 sided faces with open ends.

    Each surface can have a different number of faces in their rows and columns.

    .. note:: 
        **Valid Target Surfaces**

        .. figure:: images/target_grid.jpg

            A valid Target Surface shaped like a grid.

        .. figure:: images/target_cylinder.jpg

            A valid Target Surface shaped like a cylinder.
        
        The vertices of the surface must be evenly spaced for Flowify to work well.  Blender's built in |Loop Tools| add-on's *Space* operation should help with this.
        
        The target surface should also consist of 4 sided faces, with 4 distinct corners for grids and 2 open ends for cylinders.  Their face directions (or |normals|) should also match the Source Grid. 

    .. warning::
        If modifiers such as the Array or Solidify modifier have been added to the Target Surface, the add-on may not work properly.  Try applying modifiers like the Array/Solidify modifier first.  Subdivision Surface modifiers should work, and if you have any issues do :ref:`contact us<contact>`.

Step by Step

    The Flowify workflow in Blender for grid surfaces

.. figure:: images/flowify_cyl_stepbystep.gif

    The Flowify workflow in Blender for cylindrical surfaces

The workflow is as follows:

#. In object mode, **select the Source Object(s)** and right-click in the viewport. Go to the 'Flowify' menu option.  Select 'Flowify' from the sub-menu that appears. 

    .. image:: images/right_click_menu.jpg

    .. tip::
        You can also select the Flowify options by clicking the 'F' icon at the top of the viewport.
        
        .. image:: images/flowify_top_menu.jpg
        

    .. tip:: 
        You can select multiple source objects at once.

#. By default, the viewport will change to :ref:`face orientation<face_orientation>` mode so you can make sure the face directions (or |normals|) of the **Source Grid** and **Target Surface** are pointing in the same way (ie the same blue colour).  

   You can resolve these issues by selecting the faces in edit mode, pressing Alt-N for the *Normals* menu, and selecting the *Flip* command.  If you need to make the normals more consistent and pointing outside, also try the 'Recalculate Outside' option in the same menu.

    .. image:: images/face_orientation_mode.jpg

    .. note:: 
        .. figure:: images/face_orientation_good_bad.jpg
        
        Good and bad face orientations. Both matching sides of the source and the target surface objects should be blue for the add-on to work correctly.  Red faces denote faces with their directions (or |Normals|) pointing in the opposite direction.

#. Hover the mouse over the **Source Grid** to detect a corner on the grid.  When a corner is detected, a circle will appear on the corner.  Click the left mouse button to select this corner and continue.

    .. image:: images/source_grid_corner_circle.jpg


    .. note::
        For cylindrical target surfaces, *always* select the "Top Left" corner of the source grid:

        .. image:: images/cyl_top_left_selection.jpg

#. Hover the mouse over the **Target Surface** and click the matching corner.  A line should appear between the Source Grid and the Target Surface, indicating how the mapping will be applied.

    .. note::
        **Matching Corners**

        It is important that the corner of the **Source Grid** is aligned to the same representative corner on the **Target Surface** to match the correct orientation.
        
        For **Grids**, the matching corner is the equivilent corner that was selected on the Source Grid.

        .. figure:: images/grid_corner_selection.jpg

            Grid Corner Selection

        For **Cylinders**, select a point along the 'top' end of the surface.  This will be the start point of the deformation and match the 'top left' corner selected on the Source Grid.

        .. figure:: images/cyl_top_selection.jpg

            Cylinder Top Rim Selection


#. The **Source Object** should be mapped onto the Target Surface in a new object called *Source Object* + *Flowify*. The **Source Grid** is subdivided into faces that you can use as a reference for the position of the **Source Object** on the **Target Surface**.
    
   In this object, there is a :ref:`Flowify Modifier<modifier_settings>` which has :ref:`additional settings<modifier_settings>`:
